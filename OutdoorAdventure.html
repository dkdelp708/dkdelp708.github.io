		<p> It was Saturday morning and it was beautiful out. I awoke living in the <ins id = 'neighborhood'> Queen Anne </ins> neighborhood and decided to get a coffee at <ins id = 'coffeeShop'> Uptown Espresso </ins>. My favorite coffee drink is <ins id = 'favoriteCoffee'> Peppermint Mocha </ins>. Afterwards, I walked to <ins id = 'favoritePark'> Kerry Park </ins> and <ins id = 'parkActivity'> relaxed infront of the beautiful Seattle skyline </ins>. </p>
		<p class = "lunch"> After awhile I began to get hungry, and because it was so nice out I decided a picnic would be a great idea. I went to the grocery store and purchased <ins id = 'picnicItems'> apples, cucumbers, gardettos, a naked juice, and some Elysian IPAs </ins>. I also thought to myself why have a picnic by myself? I called <ins id = 'picnicFriends'> my friends Andy, Nate, Tyler, Kyle, Kristen, and Marianna </ins> to come join. We ate some food, drank some beer and decided to play <ins id = 'picnicActivity'> Frisbee </ins>.
		</p>
		<p class = 'dinner'> We had a blast and time flew by and it was about <ins id = 'leftParkTime'> 5:00pm </ins> and we all decided to go to our favorite local bar <ins id = 'favoriteLocalBar'> Red Papaya </ins>. I ordered <ins id = 'dinnerMeal'> the beef Pho with extra meat, and I put lots of hot sauce in mine </ins>. After dinner, we decided to go dancing at <ins id = 'danceClub'> The Foundation Nightclub </ins>. We danced the night away, and had a blast. Eventually, I called it a night at 3:00 AM. What a fun day that was! </p>
