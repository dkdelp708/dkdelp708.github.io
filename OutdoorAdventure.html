	<p> It was Saturday morning and it was beautiful out. I awoke living in the <ins id = 'neighborhood'> Queen Anne </ins> neighborhood and decided to get a coffee at <ins id = 'coffeeShop'> Uptown Espresso </ins>. My favorite coffee drink is <ins id = 'favoriteCoffee'> Peppermint Mocha </ins>. Afterwards, I walked up to <ins id = 'favoritePark'> Kerry Park </ins> and <ins id = 'parkActivity'> take a look at beautiful Seattle </ins>
